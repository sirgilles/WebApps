MSA Web-Apps

- The persona who would use my app is someone who is hosting a party but without extensive organisation. At the last minute, they realise all they have to entertain their guests is a single deck of cards. Alas, my app will assist them in utilising their deck to the fullest by giving them an extensive list of games they could try, with links to each set of rules. The target audience could be any age, gender or occupation, they just need to be friends with a group who enjoys a simple game of cards, a passion of mine.

- The app could be extended to include non-card games and board games, which would expand the audience to be more inclusive of more serious gamers and also family gamers. My user can add/delete any games they wish to their own list, to keep a full record of games they enjoy (and only those games).
